## Objectives
The objective of this report is to develop a new model that predicts taxi demand around Manhattan and the airports. This model aims to improve efficiency and increase profits for Super Taxis by focusing on high-demand regions and avoiding low-demand ones. The findings of this report will be presented to Mr. Walker and the business team, detailing the potential impact and implementation of the model.

## Brief Description
Manhattan is typically divided into distinct regions: Lower Manhattan, Midtown, Upper East Side, and Upper West Side. Additionally, this analysis includes the LaGuardia and JFK airports. The model will take into account these specific regions to provide accurate demand predictions.

## Features
- **Demand Prediction Model**: Develops a model to predict taxi demand in Manhattan and airports.
- **Region-Specific Analysis**: Considers distinct regions within Manhattan as well as LaGuardia and JFK airports.
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Aims to enhance operational efficiency by targeting high-demand areas.
- **Profit Increase**: Focuses on increasing profits by avoiding low-demand regions.

## Technical Details
- **MATLAB**: The entire project is implemented using MATLAB.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes various data analysis techniques to identify demand patterns and trends.

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and run the MATLAB scripts. Ensure you have the necessary MATLAB toolboxes installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hansen2102/Predicting-Demand-for-Taxi-Data
cd demand-prediction-model
```

Open MATLAB and run the main script:

```bash
run('main_script.m')
```
